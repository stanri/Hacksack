# Overview
This project was developed in the last week of my 6.MITx UROP's summer bootcamp and is a working simulation of the knapsack problem with a burgler stealing items from a house. Users can compare different 'stealing' strategies and see what yields the greatest net profit with the imposed weight constrain, which is, by default, 20kg.

# Coded by
This visualization was primarily coded by me, with help from my fellow UROP students.
