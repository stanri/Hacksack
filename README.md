## Overview
This project was developed in the last week of my 6.MITx UROP's summer bootcamp and is a working simulation of the knapsack problem. In this visualization, students are asked to experiment with different methods of gathering files, given a constraint on the number of gigabytes their flash drive holds and a value for each file they can steal.

## Contributors
This visualization was primarily coded by me, built after seeing an original layout example given to me by one of my supervisors, Chris Terman.
